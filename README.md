## Introduction

This is an assignment from a Coursera class called Exploratory Data Analysis, which is part of the Johns Hopkins data science certificate program.

The data comes from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets.

## Loading the data

I included the code to actutally load the data from the Web site in each file.

This is a pretty big dataset though, so you might want to just load it once to save time.

However, if you're grading me and that doesn't work, please try executing the entire file :)




## Making Plots / Submitting to Github

**Please Note:** I am on a Mac, and as such, directory names may differ from machine to machine.

If you have any problems with downloading the data, it may be because you don't have a ~/Downloads directory.

Please make the necessary adjustments :)

Each item follows the following instructions :

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading
the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also
include the code that creates the PNG file.

* Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to
GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to
date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.

The files are in this directory.  Thanks for your input!
